# AoC2022

These are my solutions for [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022). Each day, a different language!

## Why a different language each day?

Just for fun. I like trying out different languages and environments.

## Information
Don't expect an elegant or efficient solution for any of the days, I'm trying to learn as I go along!

I am going to try to document my opinions on each language (setup, developer experiance, debugging ect), but won't pass too just judgement over a few small programming tasks.

### IDEs
I am attempting to use Jetbrains IDEs for each language, assuming it has (un)official support. If it doesn't, or the dev experiance isn't great I will move onto VSCode, and if that isn't great then I will use a standard text editor such as Sublime or Notepad++.

### Operating System
Most are developed on Windows natively, unless the compiler/runtime of the language only runs on Linux, then I will use WSL/Kubuntu. Some solutions might behave differently on other enviornments, or not compile at all!

## Languages Used

1. Dart
2. Pascal
3. C
4. C++
