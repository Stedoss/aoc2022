# 02-pascal

## My thoughts

### Installation

I already had the FPC installed on my work machine, and it works great from the CLI (Lazarus was not installed, sorry!). The warnings the compiler gives (eg. unused variables) are a bit OTT, such as warnings for the compiler not being able to inline some (all?) of the builtin map functions.

### Language Design

You can see why it's not used a whole lot these days, but I have a soft spot for it. I learned it in college, and I think it's a great starter language. The lack of community libraries is a shame, but it's fun to work on some Pascal from time-to-time.

### Developer Experience

Jetbrains and VSCode didn't really work great, so I used Sublime. It was fine, but it had trouble with indentation and `begin-end` blocks. The compiler CLI was simple and functional, and useful error messages were given when I did silly things.

### Overall

It's a neat little language that no one really uses these days. Its GUI toolkit is decent, but the lack of libraries and good IDE integrations kill it a little for me.
