# 01-dart

## My thoughts

### Installation

The compiler came with Flutter (I already had it installed on my Kubuntu laptop!) and worked right out of the box. The CLI was simple, and allowed me to compile easily.

### Language Design

As primarily a C# and Java developer, the language felt right at home for me. Seems like a great choice if you are an existing developer of one of those languages and want to try something else (and dive into Flutter!).

No array types threw me a bit (everything seems to be a list?), but overall enjoyed it a lot.

### Developer Experience

I used VSCode (all that I had installed on my laptop at the time) and it worked very well. Syntax errors appeared immediately and were helpful, overall great!

### Overall

Very happy, and it is making me excited to try out some Flutter sometime!
